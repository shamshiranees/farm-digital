          "The Cotton orchard is located Punjab. It is located in a highly sought after area that is located between two rivers. The soil is very fertile and is excellent for growing most crops.The property consists of approximately 15 acres of Sugarcane orchard and 1 acre which contains an improved farmstead site, with a dwelling and detached garage, well site and farm avenues. The property is rectangular in shape, with level topography.The orchard is five years old and nearing peak maturation, itâ€™s set to hit its average production output by 2021. In it's 2020 harvest, the orchard realized an 8.8% higher production than estimated with a 6% higher than estimated sales price.This is a very unique variety of Wheat seed that does not require bees to pollinate individual blossoms. This saves a considerable amount of money, and boosts profitability on a year-to-year basis.",
